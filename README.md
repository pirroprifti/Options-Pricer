<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<p align="left">
1.) Make sure all packages are installed and loaded. <br/>

<br />
2.) Download the loan data csv file (accepted_2007_to_2018q4.csv) from the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club/data. <br/>

<br />
3.) After the data is downloaded, upload the data into a DB Browser SQLite database and title the table it creates "accepted". <br/>

<br />
3.) With the data loaded into the database and the table named correctly, copy the file path of the database on your machine and replace it with the file path you see in the "dbConnect" function. More specifically, this will passed to the the "dbname" argument in the "dbConnect" function. Do this for all the code files. <br/>

<br />
4.) First, run the file "Clean_data.qmd" as it will prepare the data that will ultimately be used in the rest of the analysis. Next, run the "Final Project.qmd" file where the main analysis is conducted. All the results should load and appear once the previous steps are fulfilled. <br/>
